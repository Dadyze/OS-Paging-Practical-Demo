# OS Paging Practical Demo

This project is a practical demonstration of paging in operating systems. It is implemented in C++ and showcases the basic concepts of how paging works, including the management of virtual memory.

## Features

- **Paging Simulation**: Simulates the paging mechanism used in modern operating systems.
- **Memory Management**: Demonstrates how pages are mapped from virtual memory to physical memory.
- **Page Fault Handling**: Simulates page faults and their resolution through loading the required pages into memory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you will need:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- A development environment that supports C++ projects (optional).

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dadyze/OS-Paging-Practical-Demo.git
   cd OS-Paging-Practical-Demo
   ```

2. Open the solution file `StranicenjePractical.sln` in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio) and build the project.

3. Run the executable generated by the build process.

### Usage

Upon running the program, you will be able to observe the paging process in action, including how pages are loaded into memory and how page faults are handled. Follow the instructions provided within the program for further interaction.
